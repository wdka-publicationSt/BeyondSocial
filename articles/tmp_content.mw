''The video of the key-note presentation of Annelys de Vet on 'Disarming Design from Palestine' will be uploaded here soon.'' 

''(WdKA symposium 'Redesigning Business', Maassilo Rotterdam, November 20 2014)''


Recently I have set up the project 'Disarming Design from Palestine'. This is an inclusive design label that presents functional products from Palestine, which provide an alternative narrative to what you might usually find in the high street. The goods are developed, designed and produced by contemporary designers, artists and students in Palestine and abroad in collaboration with local artisans and producers. The first collection was launched in October this year. In my presentation I will share with you the constant need for improvisation in the context of the project 'Disarming Design from Palestine'.


Annelys de Vet is a graphic researcher and cultural designer, and runs the design studio [http://www.bureaudevet.be DEVET] in Brussels. She also works as a curator and is head of the design department at the Sandberg Instituut Amsterdam. She is the initiator and designer of the 'Subjective Atlases' (of countries and regions such as Palestine, Serbia, and the Dutch Frisian province of Frysl√¢n), which map countries and regions from individual perspectives.
