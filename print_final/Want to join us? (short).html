<p>The following page will guide you through the process of creating an account and your first article for the Beyond Social webzine.</p>
<h3 id="welcome">Welcome</h3>
<p>Thank you so much for joining us in making the Beyond Social webzine a success! Naturally, we cordially invite all those who are interested to join us. Because we want to abide by a high standard for our webzine, there are some rules on how to submit an article. We are trying to have as few constraints on your creative input as possible, but at the same time we still want to guarantee that high <em style="font-style: normal; letter-spacing: -1px">standard.</em></p>
<h3 id="some-background-information">Some background information</h3>
<p>The back end of our webzine is a Wiki (http://www.wiki matrix.org/), an internet collaboration and web page hypertext creation software well-known for being part of <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> and its subsidiaries. If you are well-known with editing Wiki pages, you shouldn't have any problem creating a Wiki page for the Beyond Social webzine. You will need to adhere to some of the house rules that we have here at Beyond Social to ensure that your page is properly included in the website. If you do not have any experience with a wiki, don't back out either: this instructable will inform you of the <br> basics of the Wiki system and will enable you to write <br>your article or story in no time!</p>
<h3 id="creating-an-account-and-logging-in">Creating an account and logging in</h3>
<p>The first step is to create an account. First, go to http://www.beyond-social.org/wiki/ and click on <br>"Create Account"</p>

<p>Next, fill in the credentials you will use for the Beyond <br> Social webzine as in the URL below. You'll probably know the name of the designer after whom the Art Academy of Rotterdam is named.</p>

</figure>
<p style="margin-top: -10px">If you fill in your email address, we will be able to contact you should there be anything amiss with your account or if you lose your password. Next, you can login using the <em>login</em> button above.</p>
<h3 id="creating-your-first-article">Creating your first Article</h3><p> </p>
<h4 id="creating-a-new-page">Creating a new page</h4>
<p>To create a new page, adapt your URL such that it looks like this: http://www.beyond-social.org/wiki/index.php/I Want A New Page, where "I Want A New Page" is the title of your article, only allowing letters (lower capital or capital) and spaces represented by an underscore (_). In the <br> example below, the article would be called "I Want A <br>New Page".</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure style="width: 80%; margin: 5%;">

</figure>
<p>Next, click on enter and you will be presented with a blank page, informing you of the fact that your title is indeed a new title. Click on the 'edit' button to proceed.</p>

<p>After clicking the 'edit' button, you'll be presented with a text editor, not unlike Office.</p>
